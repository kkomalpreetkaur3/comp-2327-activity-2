## Additional Information

- Abstraction: Implemented abstract Shape class with abstract methods for area and primeter.
- Inheritance: Triangle and Rectangle inherit from Shape, __init__ and __str__ via super().
- Polymorphism: Subclass override abstract methods, allowing uniform calls to calculate_area, calculate_perimeter on different shapes.
